# Artificial_Intelligence_greedy_searches
This program takes Source, Destination, Node names, number of nodes and the tree(in matrix form) as input. Also takes the type of greedy algorithm, the user wants to use (1 for Breadth First Search, 2 for Depth First Search, 3 for Uniform Cost Search). The program outputs the traced path, shortest path and the cost of the solution as the output.

Sample input file:

3
A
D
4
A
B
C
D
0 5 2 0
5 0 0 0
2 0 0 6
0 0 6 1

where 3 = UCS
A = Source
D = Destination
4 = Number of Nodes
A, B, C, D = Names of the nodes
matrix = Search Tree
